photo editing in a “do it yourself” approach.

Have you ever wondered how snapchat filters work? Or those Photo Booth effects?
Photo manipulation is a huge part of our 21st century culture. And coding
literacy is a core skill at this point. Don’t take for granted how simple it is
to click a button to make a photo black & white or pixelated or colorized. In
this workshop you will learn the basic mechanics behind photo editing in a “do
it yourself” approach.

The workshop lead is an internationally recognized coder who’s been a long-time
influencer in the industry since its inception. In fact, John Henry Thompson’s
coding language is the predecessor of Flash & JavaScript. Learn from the
originator of photo filters. It is an exciting and accessible way to learn “do
it yourself” photo editing.

This is applicable knowledge for anyone in any field or interest (computer
science, but also engineering, design, art, business, data analysis, etc).
